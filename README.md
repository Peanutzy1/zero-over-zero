# Welcome to my button (maybe engine idk)
i am trying to replicate the upgrade trees from some roblox games
its canvas based js
here are my insparation: (both roblox games)

- The difficulty upgrade tree: regrown
- Everything upgrade tree

## status

### missing features
- button descriptions is not done yet.
- stylized buttons is going to be a pain..
- quadtree
- a fuckton more stuff will *probably* come

## notes 
**expect chaos im 14 while writing this**

- i kinda suck at coding rn so i do need help writing some parts and telling me how to organize my code / how to do github by ai chatbots..
- otherwise i do have to manage more than 70-80% of the code and die in the process
